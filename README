# superdelta2
Superdelta procedure for multiple group differential expression analysis

This is the first working version of superdelta2() that collects all scripts for relevant functions.
The pipeline will work thoroughly, including the following components:

1. A main function working on differential gene expression analysis procedure that can be implemented for RNA-seq data and multiple group comparisons.
2. A general function of per row t-test.
3. A handy function for obtaining substrings of character strings.
4. Other necessary functions such as heatmap creating, and user-friendly prediction.

This project aims at building a comprehensive analysis pipeline to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes of cancer patients, or other diseases or clinical subgroups of interest. The underlying biological mechanism of DE genes will also be carefully investigated on both gene level and pathway level. The whole procedure will practically shed light to the differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data.
